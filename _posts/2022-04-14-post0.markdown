Welcome to Roger's website. My name is 羅啟仁 (Lo Chi-Jen) in Mandarin. I'm from Taiwan and now doing my Ph.D. at [University of Cambridge] majoring [Information Engineering]. 

My name has a lot to do with communications. First of all, "Roger" is widely used in radio communication as a response on the reception of a message. On the other hand, my last name 羅 "Lo", from “Lo and Behold”, coincides with the first message sent over the Internet, from UCLA to Stanford via ARPANET, in Sep 1969.

Another self-introduction (and my curriculum vitae) can be found in [About]. An overview of my research lies in [Research]. This website also contains several records of my thoughts and experience to share with. Please access these posts through [Homepage] or [Archives]. Last but not least, you may recognize a more stereoscopic me though my treasured [Reading], [Quotes], and [Photos]. Thank you for browsing my site.

<!--- Welcome to Roger's website. My Taiwanese name in Mandarin is 羅啟仁 (Lo Chi-Jen). The main purpose of building this website is to enhance my applications towards the MPhil/PhD programs. Professors can access to not only my personal information, my CV, yet many more dimensions of me through simply survey this site. Since Professors are usually very busy and have lots of tasks to deal with beyond researches, I hope this simple, concise, and clear personal website can reduce their burden. I started building this website after receiving the interview request in 9, March, from the University of Cambridge. Apart from this I've also applied for other great universities like the University of Edinburgh, UCL, King's and Imperial. All final results are not revealed so far.

I wrote a brief self-introduction in [About]. My research progress lies in [Research]. This website also contains several records of my relevant course works, presentation slides, extracurricular performances, and specificially there's a post about how I build up my mindset and philosophy. Please access these posts through [Homepage] or [Archives]. Last but not least, you may recognize a more stereoscopic me though my treasured [Reading], [Quotes], and [Photos]. Thank you very much for browsing my website. I hope you like it! --->
