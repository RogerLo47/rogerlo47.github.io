Beyond intensive academic tasks, I also actively join student activities, especially during my freshman and sophomore years. I did build up some qualities through these events, especially when I had to deal with people from very different backgrounds and mindsets. My social abilities was finely established in those years, and may help me a lot lifelong. Nevertheless, I intend to dive fully into acadmic in the coming years abroad.
