<h3>Information-Centric Stochastic Network Scheduling</h3>

<p>This research is conducted under the mentorship of my thesis advisor, <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=942014">Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh</a>.</p>

<p>This work has been submitted to ISIT, which is now under review. The contents in this paper will become the mainframe of my thesis. This work considers "information-centric" 
scheduling. We can simply distinguish "information" into three dimensions, that is, the quantity, the quality, and the freshness (information age/delay). In this paper, we contrive 
the information quantity by distributed source coding and queue length minimization, and the quality by a newly derived information-theoretic bound and fidelity requirement. 
Recently, I'm thinking about adding in a new metric called Age of Information (AoI), which is likely to become the rest of my thesis.</p>

<p>We extend the classic Slepian-Wolf-Cover bound and propose an information-theoretic bound that allows compression rate to vary in different scheduling periods. This extension allows 
the scheduler to decide and allocate the communication resources period by period, without knowing the statistical information of the sources in advance. Here's its beautiful proof:</p>

<p>We also show the slides for presentation in the following:</p>

<p>An extended journal version with all proofs and details is written as well. Whereas more evaluations should be added in before submission.</p>

<p>I have research experience also in several other fields, and here I show them by a table as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>[Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications Lab, NTU, Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh]</b></li>
  A first author paper was submitted to IEEE ISIT 2021 (now under review), where we focus on stochas- tic network scheduling problems applied to wireless M2M networks and IWSNs in a data-centric regime.
  <li><b>[Artificial Intelligence and Multimedia Lab, NTU, Prof. Tsung-Nan Lin]</b></li>
  Designed and implemented a software-defined network (SDN) routing policy with meter-based method for enhancing the QoS of video streaming services. Built an intelligent dialogue agent for the front desks.
  <li><b>[Data Management and Information Discovery Lab, Academia Sinica, Dr. De-Nian Yang]</b></li>
  Conducting research about social IoTs for the surveillance of COVID-19 pandemic, in which we use spatio-temporal Hawkes process for modelling infectious events.
  <li><b>[Video and Image Processing Lab, NTU, Prof. Wen-Ming Yan]</b></li>
  Presented a paper about determinant, hoping to smooth out its awkward appearance in modern linear algebra. Several new definitions of determinants are also discussed.
  <li><b>[Intelligent Vehicle and Mechatronics Lab, NTU, Prof. Kang Li]</b></li>
  Applied SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and YOLOv3 (computer vision toolkit) on a automated guided vehicle (AGV). Imported a self-driving bus into NTU.

<h3>An Intuitive Interpretation of Determinants</h3>
<p>In this research we've tried to define and interpret the concept of matrix determinants in a more intuitive manner. This is a project with Prof. Wen-Ming Yan from the Computer Science and 
Information Engineering Department at National Taiwan University.<\p>

<h3>Compass and Straightedge Construction on a Sphere</h3>

<p>Assume P as the set of constructible polygons on the plane, and S as the set of constructible polygons on a sphere. In this work we prove that P=S with some properties in spherical 
trigonometry and the technique of finite field extension. The proof was all done but hasn't been fully typed out yet. Below are some sketch diagrams made with LaTeX MetaPost.</p>
